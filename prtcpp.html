<h1>Dave Aronson's C++ and Rational Rose Portfolio</h1>

<p><hr>

<p class="di">This is a combined demo of C++ and Rational Rose.  It is a
variation on the classic Life cellular automata program.  "Improvements"
include using three different species, with sexes.  Live cells must
still have only 3, 4, or 5 neighbors to survive, but in order to
generate a new lifeform, there must be a female next to the blank space,
with a male of the same species somewhere next to her (not necessarily
in the same direction).  Searches for both the female and the male
proceed as on a telephone number pad, as does the process of "time" in
general (i.e., which cells get to "go").

<p class="di">You can download the following files, for a project that I
modeled in Rational Rose and built with Borland C++.  There are a few
"Borlandisms" in it, but it should be easily adaptable to ANSI:

<p>
<ul>

 <li><a href="wildlife.cpp">wildlife.cpp</a>, the main program

 <li><a href="world.cpp">world.cpp</a> and <a
 href="world.h">world.h</a>, the class that holds the primary parameters

 <li><a href="cell.cpp">cell.cpp</a> and <a href="cell.h">cell.h</a>,
 the class that provides proximity services, generation of new life
 forms in empty spaces, etc.

 <li><a href="life.cpp">life.cpp</a> and <a href="life.h">life.h</a>,
 the base class of all life forms

 <li><a href="animal.cpp">animal.cpp</a> and <a
 href="animal.h">animal.h</a>, the animal life forms (eventually to be
 split up further)

 <li><a href="plant.cpp">plant.cpp</a> and <a
 href="plant.h">plant.h</a>, the plant life forms (eventually to be
 split up further)

 <li><a href="lffctory.cpp">lffctory.cpp</a> and <a
 href="lffctory.h">lffctory.h</a>, the class that creates a new life
 form, either randomly chosen or to duplicate an existing one

 <li><a href="wildlife.ide">wildlife.ide</a>, the Borland project file

 <li><a href="wildlife.exe">wildlife.exe</a>, the executable

 <li><a href="wildlife.mdl">wildlife.mdl</a>, the Rational Rose model

</ul>
